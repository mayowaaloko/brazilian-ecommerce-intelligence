    "churn": "\n    📊 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:\n    The churn model shows moderate performance (AUC: 0.621), \n    which is reasonable for customer behavior prediction in e-commerce.\n\n    💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:\n    1. **Proactive Retention**: Target customers predicted to churn with personalized offers \n       within 30 days of their last purchase\n    2. **Segment-Specific Strategies**: Different retention tactics for high-value vs \n       low-value customers based on CLV predictions\n    3. **Monitor Key Triggers**: Track delivery delays and review scores as early warning signals\n\n    ⚠️ LIMITATIONS:\n    - Model trained on limited repeat purchase data (most are one-time buyers)\n    - May not capture sudden market changes or seasonal patterns\n    - Requires quarterly retraining with fresh data\n    ",
    "clv": "\n    📊 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:\n    Excellent predictive accuracy (R²: 0.9847) indicates strong \n    linear relationship between customer behavior and spending patterns.\n\n    💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:\n    1. **Customer Segmentation**: Use CLV predictions to create tiered loyalty programs \n       (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)\n    2. **Marketing Budget Allocation**: Invest more in acquiring and retaining high-CLV customers\n    3. **Personalized Experiences**: Customize product recommendations and offers based on \n       predicted lifetime value\n\n    💰 BUSINESS IMPACT:\n    With average prediction error of only $10.43, the company \n    can accurately forecast customer value and optimize acquisition costs accordingly.\n    ",
    "revenue": "\n    📊 PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT:\n    Strong forecasting capability (MAPE: 867.23%) enables \n    reliable revenue predictions for operational planning.\n\n    💡 RECOMMENDATIONS:\n    1. **Inventory Planning**: Use 7-day forecasts to optimize stock levels and reduce holding costs\n    2. **Cash Flow Management**: Predict slow periods 30 days ahead to manage liquidity\n    3. **Marketing Timing**: Schedule campaigns during predicted low-revenue periods\n\n    📈 USE CASES:\n    - Weekly revenue projections for department planning\n    - Monthly forecasts for board reporting\n    - Anomaly detection (actual vs predicted gaps indicate issues)\n    ",
