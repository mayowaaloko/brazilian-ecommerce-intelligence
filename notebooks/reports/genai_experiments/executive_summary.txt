OVERVIEW:
Five predictive models have been deployed to enable data-driven decision making:
1. Customer Churn Prediction (AUC: 0.621)
2. Customer Lifetime Value (R²: 0.9847)
3. Revenue Forecasting (MAPE: 867.23%)
4. Review Score Prediction (Acc: 82.3%)
5. Product Recommendations (Collaborative Filtering)

KEY FINDINGS:
• 80% of customers are one-time buyers - major churn risk
• High-value customers (top 20%) generate 60% of revenue
• Delivery delays are #1 driver of negative reviews
• Revenue forecasting enables proactive inventory management

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Launch targeted retention campaign for high-CLV at-risk customers
2. Implement dynamic pricing based on churn probability
3. Use revenue forecasts for weekly inventory optimization
4. Address delivery delays to improve satisfaction scores

EXPECTED IMPACT:
• Reduce churn by 15-20% among high-value segment
• Increase average CLV by 10-15% through retention
• Improve forecast accuracy to 90%+ for better planning
• Boost customer satisfaction scores by 0.5 points

NEXT STEPS:
→ Deploy models to production API
→ Create real-time dashboards in PowerBI
→ Train customer service team on insights
→ Establish monthly model performance reviews
